<p>UnsyncMDSnapshot capability is provided when the module supports getting unsynchronized snapshots via <a href="msgtypes/MarketDataRequest">MarketDataRequest</a> (<a href="fields/SubscriptionRequestType">SubscriptionRequestType</a> set to '0'). The resulting snapshot is not synchronized with data feed emitted via PUB and is returned in the resulting <a href="msgtypes/ZMMarketDataRequestResponse">ZMMarketDataRequestResponse message</a>.</p>

<p>UnsyncMDSnapshot is not required by <a href="glossary/connector_level_api">connector level api</a> and will be provided by mdcache (or sub2snap?) middleware if necessary, given that the <a href="caps/MDSubscribe">MDSubscribe capability</a> is provided. Simulated UnsyncMDSnapshot will have some delay due to the fact that that the incremental data needs some time to aggregate before it can be emitted, representing approximately the full state at the given moment.</p>
