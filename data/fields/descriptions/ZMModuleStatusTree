Contains an recursive free-form JSON that contains the status of the <a href="glossary/upstream">upstream</a> part of the tree.</p>

<p>The resulting tree is formed as a recursive list where each branching point is a list of lists. Each item in the list that is not a branching point is an object containing status of a module. If module branches it will be followed by a branching point item. Branching point item is always logically the last item of the list unless we reach an endpoint.</p>

<p>TODO: show examples</p>

<p>Fields for each module:</p>
<p><table>
	<tr>
		<th>Field name</th>
		<th>Required?</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>module_name</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Name of the ZMAPI module.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>endpoint_name</td>
		<td></td>
		<td>Name of the endpoint, required for connectors and pseudo-connectors.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>session_id</td>
		<td>Y</td>
		<td>Unique identifier of the current session. Used to detect when module is restarted.</td>
	</tr>
</table></p>
