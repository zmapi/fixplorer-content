<p>Module tree is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree-like</a> structure of modules where furthest <a href="glossary/downstream">downstream</a> nodes are the modules where which provide full abstraction and features for clients and furthest upstream nodes are the <a href="glossary/connector">connectors</a> or <a href="glossary/simulated_connector">simulated connectors</a>. Between downstream and upstream ends of the tree can be any number of middleware modules that facilitate the standardization specified in ZMAPI.</p>
